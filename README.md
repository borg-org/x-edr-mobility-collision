Mobility - Collision Library

This repository contains a collection of classes and functions to
check for collisions and generally represent obstacles and robot
geometries in 2D. This is a practical and well-tested library
for simply collision checks for 2D robots. This library also
includes functions to transform geometries to reflect the
position, orientation and speed of an object (e.g., stopping
distance).
